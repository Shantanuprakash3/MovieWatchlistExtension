## A google chrome extension 

Lets you create a movie watchlist on the fly and search for them on imdb. 

A very basic implementation. Written in a few hours starting midnight, as i decided to try out some js project, 
having learnt it recently. I intend to add a feature of storing a particular watchlist, and some better UI (dull as of now). Feel free to try it out!

Instructions to load the zipped file on chrome can be easily found on google!

Incomplete work. Still working on this!
