## A google chrome extension 

# which lets you create a movie watchlist on the fly and search for them on imdb. 

A very basic implementation. Written in a few hours starting midnight as i decided to teach myself some JS. I intend to add
feature of storing a particular watchlist, and some better UI (there's none as of now). Feel free to try it out!
Instructions to load  a zipped file on chrome can be easily found on google!
